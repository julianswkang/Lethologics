# Lethologics 

This chrome extension is called Lethologics. Lethologica is defined as the inability to remember a particular word or name. We believed that while this is a clone of Wordle, the word 'lethologica', was a better name simply because of the puzzling and frustrating nature of the game.

This was created in collaboration with [Matthew Lapeer](github.com/matthewlapeer). We implemented the standard rules of Wordle, while altering the styling of the game.

## v1.0.0:
-Limited library of 5-letter words (The original game of Wordle has an extremely extensive library, of 10,000+ words!)
-Cannot save current game -- will reset the game when the extension is closed.
-Does not keep score, yet! No caching of any sort, as connected to the feature above.
-The dictionary used for the main.js file is hard coded in -- we look to incorporate some API that will provide us with randomly generated 5 letter words that our program can randomly choose from.
