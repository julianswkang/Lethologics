#Lethologics as a chrome extension

This chrome extension is called Lethologics. Lethologica is defined as the inability to remember a particular word or name. We believed that while this is a clone of Wordle, the word 'lethologica', was a better name simply because of the puzzling and frustrating nature of the game.

This was created in collaboration with Matthew Lapeer. We implemented the standard rules of Wordle, while altering the styling of the game.

Currently on version 1.0:
-Limited library of 5-letter words (The original game of Wordle has an extremely extensive library, of 10,000+ words!)
-Cannot save current game -- will reset the game when the extension is closed.
-Does not keep score, yet! No caching of any sort, as connected to the feature above.
-The dictionary used for the main.js file is hard coded in -- we look to incorporate some API that will provide us with randomly generated 5 letter words that our program can randomly choose from.
